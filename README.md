# Weight Loss Tracking

-Our primary goal aims to train a linear regression machine learning model which predicts the average daily calorie consumption based on an individualâ€™s average daily activity information, such as daily walking steps, walking distance, very active minutes and so on./n
-Our secondary goal aims to train an ensemble regression learning model given the same dataset to explore how we can combine multiple regression models to improve the accuracy and overall performance of prediction beyong linear regression./n
-Lastly, we hope to create an interactive and engaging atmosphere for our members to share ideas, tell stories, practice ML skills, strengthen leadership, teamwork and communication skills.
